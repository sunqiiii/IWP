It started with Floyd D Jinx Walker and soon thereafter his brother Russet R. Bus Walker joined him. The business then shifted to Jinx's son, Richard H. Dick Walker.

Reviews: * Beyond its history of reliability and high resale value, the Accord is now more varied than ever. Whether you want a no-fuss and highly economical sedan, a sporty V6-powered coupe or a hybrid that attains 50 mpg in the city, the 2014 Accord offers something for everyone. Source: KBB.com * The Accord is synonymous with Honda and has been known for nearly four decades as a reliable, comfortable, pragmatic way to move families. What began as a 2-door hatchback in 1976 has grown into today's full-size sedan and coupe. Like the rest of the car, the 2014 Accord's 5-passenger interior is a pleasing step forward. The cabin boasts soft-touch materials for a quality feel. The front seats are comfortable, and the driver's seat actually toned down the lumbar support. The rear seats have even more room, as does the trunk. Sleek, rippled sheet metal defines a more streamlined exterior that has shrunk around an interior that feels roomier than previous generations. The most surprising thing about the Accord is its refined continuously variable transmission (CVT). Mated to the 4-cylinder, this CVT feels much like a normal automatic, mimicking gear changes. Even a base Accord has good power for acceleration and passing, yet attains an impressive mileage on the highway. Move up to a V6 model with 6-speed automatic transmission, and the Accord is downright quick. For the individual looking to consume less the 2014 Accord comes in a Hybrid version as well. This operates on a 141-hp 2.0-liter, 16-valve i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine and a 55-hp lithium-ion battery pack for a net hp of 196. The Hybrid can achieve ratings of 50 cty and 46 hwy. To help maximize efficiency on the road, the Accord Hybrid seamlessly shifts between three distinct drive modes: EV Drive, Hybrid Drive and Engine Drive. EV Drive is 100% electric, and generally is used during braking and when starting from a stop. Hybrid Drive uses the fuel engine and electric motor to provide extra zip during acceleration, and once your Accord Hybrid is cruising with highway efficiency, Engine Drive takes over. If you want a hassle-free, pleasing family car with a reputation for quality and an immediate familiarity, you can't go wrong with th>  All prices are plus applicable State sales tax, registration and title fees.

Although it is outsold by the Toyota Camry, the Accord continues to narrow the gap\\u2014and it does that without relying heavily on fleet sales, as nearly all of its rivals are wont to do. For 2017, the Honda Accord is largely unchanged aside from a new Sport Special Edition that slots in about dead center among the LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, and Touring trim levels. An Accord Coupe also remains available, essentially unchallenged in what was once a popular segment. The Accord Coupe is offered in LX-S, EX, EX-L, and Touring trims.  Eschewing a general push toward high belt lines and low roofs, Honda's Accord is a careful compromise between the upright elegance that the automaker's loyal buyers expect and the high style of competitors like the Ford Fusion and Mazda 6.  The result is a coupe and sedan that deliver more practicality than the segment's most swoopy designs, which merits an 8 for styling. But that's not to say that the Accord is slab-sided and dull. A mild refresh for 2016 brought a re-contoured aluminum hood, and LED taillights; coupes likewise gained a new look for their front and rear ends with reworked designs for the grille, headlights, and taillights. The Touring trim level now rides on big 19-inch wheels.  Honda offers an unusually wide range of engines and transmissions in its Accord lineup, including an Accord Hybrid covered in a separate review. Depending on trim level and sedan or coupe flavor, you'll have a choice between an inline-4, a V-6, a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Enthusiasts will appreciate that Honda continues to offer a slick-shifting 6-speed manual, but in the sedan it is relegated to the base LX, the Sport, and the new Sport Special Edition trim levels. Those Sport models also include 19-inch alloy wheels and larger front brakes for better handling and stopping. All Sports can also be ordered with the CVT, which is mandatory if you order Honda's suite of safety tech. Honda has kept its V-6-powered around, at a time when many rival models have gone to smaller turbocharged engines in their upmarket versions. The automaker's V-6 is a strong, smooth engine that delivers considerably more refinement than most of those small turbos. The 278 horsepower V-6 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission in sedans and most coupes, although a 6-speed manual is available in EX-L trim level two-doors. The V-6 can shut down two cylinders to save fuel under low load situations and the V-6 models feature active noise cancellation to dial out road rumble.  You'll find excellent back-seat space and a roomy trunk in all Accord sedans, as well as some of the best cabin refinement in any mid-size car, let alone some luxury class vehicles.  The Accord's cabin also ranks as one of the quietest in the class thanks to active noise control that, working like a set of Bose headphones, cuts out unwanted road and wind noise to good effect. That said, models with the larger 18-inch and 19-inch wheels make their rubber a little more audible inside. Outboard passengers will find excellent room all around in the sedan, and the coupe is even relatively spacious given the obvious ingress and egress compromises forced by just two doors.  *This vehicle is Certified Pre-Owned and is eligible for our third party warranty program.\", \"Web Link\": \"https://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/ctd/d/avondale-estates-2017-honda-accord/7653182758.html\", \"Screenshot\": \"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IWinlhRF1cwWCI29dmjK_QD90sdi0AUF\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"9/7/23 14:49\", \"Car Make\": \"Honda\", \"Car Model\": \"Accord\", \"Dealer or Individual?\": \"Dealer\", \"Price\": 14849, \"Year\": 2013, \"Location\": \"Ohio\", \"Mileage\": 125140.0, \"Doors\": 4, \"Color\": \"Modern Steel Metallic Exterior\", \"VIN#\": \"1HGCT2B81DA003543\", \"Engine\": \"3.5L 6-Cylinder Gas Engine\", \"Description\": \"2013 Honda Accord EX-L Modern Steel Metallic 3.5L V6 SOHC i-VTEC 24V 6-Speed Automatic\", \"Web Link\": \"https://www.kbb.com/cars-for-sale/vehicledetails.xhtml?listingId=692952287&zip=15201&clickType=elot\", \"Screenshot\": \"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k1ZngaPWn7p6gApwDg9iLcB2Yk5vcHLj\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"9/7/23 14:56\", \"Car Make\": \"Honda\", \"Car Model\": \"Accord\", \"Dealer or Individual?\": \"Dealer\", \"Price\": 16000, \"Year\": 2016, \"Location\": \"California\", \"Mileage\": 104278.0, \"Doors\": 4, \"Color\": \"White Orchid Pearl Exterior\", \"VIN#\": \"1HGCR2F39GA193965\", \"Engine\": \"2.4L 4-Cylinder Gas Engine\", \"Description\": \"New Price! 16 Alloy Wheels, ABS brakes, Alloy wheels, Electronic Stability Control, Front dual zone A/C, Illuminated entry, Low tire pressure warning, Remote keyless entry, Traction control.

Inc. 27/36 City/Highway MPG Reviews: * Simple operation great reliability and high resale value are obvious attractors to the Accord. But you may be surprised at the extent of its lineup which ranges from an economical sedan to a V6-powered coupe or a hybrid rated up to 50 mpg. It&amp;#226;s hard to go wrong in any of them.

All repairs and maintenances DO NOT have to be brought back to our facility. See sales associate for details. The Gerald family has been selling automobiles in the Chicago area since the mid-1930's. We have succeeded in these endeavors because of our profound respect for the customer. The name Gerald stands for honesty and the highest standard of excellence and customer treatment. Our employees are some of the most outstanding in the business. As this dealership continues to grow, it will be the result of all of our combined efforts, and our dedication and loyalty to the thousands of customers who favor us with their trust and patronage. In October of 1981, we purchased an existing Oldsmobile dealership with a collision center at 1210 East Ogden Ave. In Naperville. We added Subaru to that location in August of 1985. When General Motors announced the termination of the Oldsmobile franchise in December of 2000 we sought out other franchises to replace it. In June of 2007 we added Kia to this location. In June of 1992 we purchased an existing Nissan dealership in Naperville. In March of 1998, we built our third location and added a second Nissan franchise in the North Aurora Auto Mall. We were awarded the Subaru franchise to add to that store in 2000. In May of 2009, we purchased an existing Hyundai dealership located in the North Aurora Auto Mall. In December of 2012, we purchased an existing Kia dealership in the North Aurora Auto Mall. In August of 2014 our Kia dealership moved locations to establish their own Kia dealership in Naperville. The Collision Center remains in the building on the east side of town. On October 1, 2018 the Gerald family is proud to have acquired the Ford store in the North Aurora Auto Mall. On December 13, 2019 we purchased an existing Toyota and Honda franchise in Matteson, IL, adding to our already robust roster of prestigious vehicles.

BENEFITS OF HONDA CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED VEHICLES: Only high-quality vehicles qualify \\u2013 Not just any used Honda can be designated as a HondaTrue Certified Pre-Owned car, truck, or SUV. Vehicles must meet strict criteria and have a clean vehicle history report. CPO vehicles come with warranty coverage \\u2013 Buying a regular used car often means that you are purchasing a vehicle without a warranty. A CPO Honda vehicle comes with a 7-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty in addition to non-powertrain coverage. They are more affordable \\u2013 HondaTrue CPO vehicles are in like-new condition without the hefty new car price tag. This means you can likely upgrade to a higher trim level that may be out of budget if you were shopping for a new model. Roadside Assistance Adds Peace of Mind \\u2013 You no longer have to fear unexpected automotive issues when you choose a CPO Honda vehicle: you get the benefit of Roadside Assistance coverage for the duration of the Certified Pre-Owned Limited Warranty.

We have succeeded in these endeavors because of our profound respect for the customer. The name Gerald stands for honesty and the highest standard of excellence and customer treatment. Our employees are some of the most outstanding in the business. As this dealership continues to grow, it will be the result of all of our combined efforts, and our dedication and loyalty to the thousands of customers who favor us with their trust and patronage. In October of 1981, we purchased an existing Oldsmobile dealership with a collision center at 1210 East Ogden Ave. In Naperville. We added Subaru to that location in August of 1985. When General Motors announced the termination of the Oldsmobile franchise in December of 2000 we sought out other franchises to replace it. In June of 2007 we added Kia to this location. In June of 1992 we purchased an existing Nissan dealership in Naperville. In March of 1998, we built our third location and added a second Nissan franchise in the North Aurora Auto Mall. We were awarded the Subaru franchise to add to that store in 2000. In May of 2009, we purchased an existing Hyundai dealership located in the North Aurora Auto Mall. In December of 2012, we purchased an existing Kia dealership in the North Aurora Auto Mall. In August of 2014 our Kia dealership moved locations to establish their own Kia dealership in Naperville. The Collision Center remains in the building on the east side of town. On October 1, 2018 the Gerald family is proud to have acquired the Ford store in the North Aurora Auto Mall. On December 13, 2019 we purchased an existing Toyota and Honda franchise in Matteson, IL, adding to our already robust roster of prestigious vehicles.

The answer is far simpler than you might think and it doesn't require you to read endless surveys. We are a family owned and operated business and have been so since 1916. It started with Floyd D Jinx Walker and soon thereafter his brother Russet R. Bus Walker joined him. The business then shifted to Jinx's son, Richard H. Dick Walker. Today, Richard's three sons, Rick, Randy and Craig run Walker Brothers. The Walker family has been a part of your community for nearly 100 years. Being a part of the community means we know each other, we're a part of each others lives and that's why making sure you have the right car for you and your family when you need it is so important to us.

Reviews: * Beyond its history of reliability and high resale value, the Accord is now more varied than ever. Whether you want a no-fuss and highly economical sedan, a sporty V6-powered coupe or a hybrid that attains 50 mpg in the city, the 2014 Accord offers something for everyone. Source: KBB.com * The Accord is synonymous with Honda and has been known for nearly four decades as a reliable, comfortable, pragmatic way to move families. What began as a 2-door hatchback in 1976 has grown into today's full-size sedan and coupe. Like the rest of the car, the 2014 Accord's 5-passenger interior is a pleasing step forward. The cabin boasts soft-touch materials for a quality feel. The front seats are comfortable, and the driver's seat actually toned down the lumbar support. The rear seats have even more room, as does the trunk. Sleek, rippled sheet metal defines a more streamlined exterior that has shrunk around an interior that feels roomier than previous generations. The most surprising thing about the Accord is its refined continuously variable transmission (CVT). Mated to the 4-cylinder, this CVT feels much like a normal automatic, mimicking gear changes. Even a base Accord has good power for acceleration and passing, yet attains an impressive mileage on the highway. Move up to a V6 model with 6-speed automatic transmission, and the Accord is downright quick. For the individual looking to consume less the 2014 Accord comes in a Hybrid version as well. This operates on a 141-hp 2.0-liter, 16-valve i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine and a 55-hp lithium-ion battery pack for a net hp of 196. The Hybrid can achieve ratings of 50 cty and 46 hwy. To help maximize efficiency on the road, the Accord Hybrid seamlessly shifts between three distinct drive modes: EV Drive, Hybrid Drive and Engine Drive. EV Drive is 100% electric, and generally is used during braking and when starting from a stop. Hybrid Drive uses the fuel engine and electric motor to provide extra zip during acceleration, and once your Accord Hybrid is cruising with highway efficiency, Engine Drive takes over. If you want a hassle-free, pleasing family car with a reputation for quality and an immediate familiarity, you can't go wrong with th>  All prices are plus applicable State sales tax, registration and title fees.

Although it is outsold by the Toyota Camry, the Accord continues to narrow the gap\\u2014and it does that without relying heavily on fleet sales, as nearly all of its rivals are wont to do. For 2017, the Honda Accord is largely unchanged aside from a new Sport Special Edition that slots in about dead center among the LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, and Touring trim levels. An Accord Coupe also remains available, essentially unchallenged in what was once a popular segment. The Accord Coupe is offered in LX-S, EX, EX-L, and Touring trims.  Eschewing a general push toward high belt lines and low roofs, Honda's Accord is a careful compromise between the upright elegance that the automaker's loyal buyers expect and the high style of competitors like the Ford Fusion and Mazda 6.  The result is a coupe and sedan that deliver more practicality than the segment's most swoopy designs, which merits an 8 for styling. But that's not to say that the Accord is slab-sided and dull. A mild refresh for 2016 brought a re-contoured aluminum hood, and LED taillights; coupes likewise gained a new look for their front and rear ends with reworked designs for the grille, headlights, and taillights. The Touring trim level now rides on big 19-inch wheels.  Honda offers an unusually wide range of engines and transmissions in its Accord lineup, including an Accord Hybrid covered in a separate review. Depending on trim level and sedan or coupe flavor, you'll have a choice between an inline-4, a V-6, a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Enthusiasts will appreciate that Honda continues to offer a slick-shifting 6-speed manual, but in the sedan it is relegated to the base LX, the Sport, and the new Sport Special Edition trim levels. Those Sport models also include 19-inch alloy wheels and larger front brakes for better handling and stopping. All Sports can also be ordered with the CVT, which is mandatory if you order Honda's suite of safety tech. Honda has kept its V-6-powered around, at a time when many rival models have gone to smaller turbocharged engines in their upmarket versions. The automaker's V-6 is a strong, smooth engine that delivers considerably more refinement than most of those small turbos. The 278 horsepower V-6 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission in sedans and most coupes, although a 6-speed manual is available in EX-L trim level two-doors. The V-6 can shut down two cylinders to save fuel under low load situations and the V-6 models feature active noise cancellation to dial out road rumble.  You'll find excellent back-seat space and a roomy trunk in all Accord sedans, as well as some of the best cabin refinement in any mid-size car, let alone some luxury class vehicles.  The Accord's cabin also ranks as one of the quietest in the class thanks to active noise control that, working like a set of Bose headphones, cuts out unwanted road and wind noise to good effect. That said, models with the larger 18-inch and 19-inch wheels make their rubber a little more audible inside. Outboard passengers will find excellent room all around in the sedan, and the coupe is even relatively spacious given the obvious ingress and egress compromises forced by just two doors.  *This vehicle is Certified Pre-Owned and is eligible for our third party warranty program.\", \"Web Link\": \"https://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/ctd/d/avondale-estates-2017-honda-accord/7653182758.html\", \"Screenshot\": \"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IWinlhRF1cwWCI29dmjK_QD90sdi0AUF\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"9/7/23 9:50\", \"Car Make\": \"Honda\", \"Car Model\": \"Accord\", \"Dealer or Individual?\": \"Dealer\", \"Price\": 7231, \"Year\": 2008, \"Location\": \"3710 Lincoln Way E - Massillon, OH 44646\", \"Mileage\": 155162.0, \"Doors\": 4, \"Color\": \"Green\", \"VIN#\": \"1HGCP26798A161804 \", \"Engine\": \"2.4L I4 DOHC i-VTEC 16V\", \"Description\": \"Priced below KBB Fair Purchase Price!

But you may be surprised at the extent of its lineup which ranges from an economical sedan to a V6-powered coupe or a hybrid rated up to 50 mpg. It&amp;#226;s hard to go wrong in any of them. Source: KBB.com * What began as a 2-door hatchback in 1976 has grown into today's full-size sedan. Like the rest of the car the Accord's 5-passenger interior is a pleasing step forward.

The rear seats have even more room as does the trunk. Sleek rippled sheet metal defines a more streamlined exterior that has shrunk around an interior that feels roomier than previous generations. The most surprising thing about the Accord is its refined continuously variable transmission (CVT). Mated to the 4-cylinder this CVT feels much like a normal automatic mimicking gear changes. Even a base Accord has good power for acceleration and passing yet attains an impressive mileage on the highway. Move up to a V6 model with 6-speed automatic transmission and the Accord is downright quick. For the individual looking to consume less the Accord comes as a Hybrid as well. This operates on a 141hp 2.0-liter 16-valve i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine and a 55hp lithium-ion battery pack for a net hp of 196. The Hybrid can achieve ratings of 50 cty and 46 hwy.

We have succeeded in these endeavors because of our profound respect for the customer. The name Gerald stands for honesty and the highest standard of excellence and customer treatment. Our employees are some of the most outstanding in the business. As this dealership continues to grow, it will be the result of all of our combined efforts, and our dedication and loyalty to the thousands of customers who favor us with their trust and patronage. In October of 1981, we purchased an existing Oldsmobile dealership with a collision center at 1210 East Ogden Ave. In Naperville. We added Subaru to that location in August of 1985. When General Motors announced the termination of the Oldsmobile franchise in December of 2000 we sought out other franchises to replace it. In June of 2007 we added Kia to this location. In June of 1992 we purchased an existing Nissan dealership in Naperville. In March of 1998, we built our third location and added a second Nissan franchise in the North Aurora Auto Mall. We were awarded the Subaru franchise to add to that store in 2000. In May of 2009, we purchased an existing Hyundai dealership located in the North Aurora Auto Mall. In December of 2012, we purchased an existing Kia dealership in the North Aurora Auto Mall. In August of 2014 our Kia dealership moved locations to establish their own Kia dealership in Naperville. The Collision Center remains in the building on the east side of town. On October 1, 2018 the Gerald family is proud to have acquired the Ford store in the North Aurora Auto Mall. On December 13, 2019 we purchased an existing Toyota and Honda franchise in Matteson, IL, adding to our already robust roster of prestigious vehicles.

The answer is far simpler than you might think and it doesn't require you to read endless surveys. We are a family owned and operated business and have been so since 1916. It started with Floyd D Jinx Walker and soon thereafter his brother Russet R. Bus Walker joined him. The business then shifted to Jinx's son, Richard H. Dick Walker. Today, Richard's three sons, Rick, Randy and Craig run Walker Brothers. The Walker family has been a part of your community for nearly 100 years. Being a part of the community means we know each other, we're a part of each others lives and that's why making sure you have the right car for you and your family when you need it is so important to us.

Reviews: * Beyond its history of reliability and high resale value, the Accord is now more varied than ever. Whether you want a no-fuss and highly economical sedan, a sporty V6-powered coupe or a hybrid that attains 50 mpg in the city, the 2014 Accord offers something for everyone. Source: KBB.com * The Accord is synonymous with Honda and has been known for nearly four decades as a reliable, comfortable, pragmatic way to move families. What began as a 2-door hatchback in 1976 has grown into today's full-size sedan and coupe. Like the rest of the car, the 2014 Accord's 5-passenger interior is a pleasing step forward. The cabin boasts soft-touch materials for a quality feel. The front seats are comfortable, and the driver's seat actually toned down the lumbar support. The rear seats have even more room, as does the trunk. Sleek, rippled sheet metal defines a more streamlined exterior that has shrunk around an interior that feels roomier than previous generations. The most surprising thing about the Accord is its refined continuously variable transmission (CVT). Mated to the 4-cylinder, this CVT feels much like a normal automatic, mimicking gear changes. Even a base Accord has good power for acceleration and passing, yet attains an impressive mileage on the highway. Move up to a V6 model with 6-speed automatic transmission, and the Accord is downright quick. For the individual looking to consume less the 2014 Accord comes in a Hybrid version as well. This operates on a 141-hp 2.0-liter, 16-valve i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine and a 55-hp lithium-ion battery pack for a net hp of 196. The Hybrid can achieve ratings of 50 cty and 46 hwy. To help maximize efficiency on the road, the Accord Hybrid seamlessly shifts between three distinct drive modes: EV Drive, Hybrid Drive and Engine Drive. EV Drive is 100% electric, and generally is used during braking and when starting from a stop. Hybrid Drive uses the fuel engine and electric motor to provide extra zip during acceleration, and once your Accord Hybrid is cruising with highway efficiency, Engine Drive takes over. If you want a hassle-free, pleasing family car with a reputation for quality and an immediate familiarity, you can't go wrong with th>  All prices are plus applicable State sales tax, registration and title fees.

Although it is outsold by the Toyota Camry, the Accord continues to narrow the gap\\u2014and it does that without relying heavily on fleet sales, as nearly all of its rivals are wont to do. For 2017, the Honda Accord is largely unchanged aside from a new Sport Special Edition that slots in about dead center among the LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, and Touring trim levels. An Accord Coupe also remains available, essentially unchallenged in what was once a popular segment. The Accord Coupe is offered in LX-S, EX, EX-L, and Touring trims.  Eschewing a general push toward high belt lines and low roofs, Honda's Accord is a careful compromise between the upright elegance that the automaker's loyal buyers expect and the high style of competitors like the Ford Fusion and Mazda 6.  The result is a coupe and sedan that deliver more practicality than the segment's most swoopy designs, which merits an 8 for styling. But that's not to say that the Accord is slab-sided and dull. A mild refresh for 2016 brought a re-contoured aluminum hood, and LED taillights; coupes likewise gained a new look for their front and rear ends with reworked designs for the grille, headlights, and taillights. The Touring trim level now rides on big 19-inch wheels.  Honda offers an unusually wide range of engines and transmissions in its Accord lineup, including an Accord Hybrid covered in a separate review. Depending on trim level and sedan or coupe flavor, you'll have a choice between an inline-4, a V-6, a 6-speed manual, a 6-speed automatic, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Enthusiasts will appreciate that Honda continues to offer a slick-shifting 6-speed manual, but in the sedan it is relegated to the base LX, the Sport, and the new Sport Special Edition trim levels. Those Sport models also include 19-inch alloy wheels and larger front brakes for better handling and stopping. All Sports can also be ordered with the CVT, which is mandatory if you order Honda's suite of safety tech. Honda has kept its V-6-powered around, at a time when many rival models have gone to smaller turbocharged engines in their upmarket versions. The automaker's V-6 is a strong, smooth engine that delivers considerably more refinement than most of those small turbos. The 278 horsepower V-6 is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission in sedans and most coupes, although a 6-speed manual is available in EX-L trim level two-doors. The V-6 can shut down two cylinders to save fuel under low load situations and the V-6 models feature active noise cancellation to dial out road rumble.  You'll find excellent back-seat space and a roomy trunk in all Accord sedans, as well as some of the best cabin refinement in any mid-size car, let alone some luxury class vehicles.  The Accord's cabin also ranks as one of the quietest in the class thanks to active noise control that, working like a set of Bose headphones, cuts out unwanted road and wind noise to good effect. That said, models with the larger 18-inch and 19-inch wheels make their rubber a little more audible inside. Outboard passengers will find excellent room all around in the sedan, and the coupe is even relatively spacious given the obvious ingress and egress compromises forced by just two doors.  *This vehicle is Certified Pre-Owned and is eligible for our third party warranty program.\", \"Web Link\": \"https://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/ctd/d/avondale-estates-2017-honda-accord/7653182758.html\", \"Screenshot\": \"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IWinlhRF1cwWCI29dmjK_QD90sdi0AUF\"}, {\"Timestamp\": \"9/7/23 9:50\", \"Car Make\": \"Honda\", \"Car Model\": \"Accord\", \"Dealer or Individual?\": \"Dealer\", \"Price\": 7231, \"Year\": 2008, \"Location\": \"3710 Lincoln Way E - Massillon, OH 44646\", \"Mileage\": 155162.0, \"Doors\": 4, \"Color\": \"Green\", \"VIN#\": \"1HGCP26798A161804 \", \"Engine\": \"2.4L I4 DOHC i-VTEC 16V\", \"Description\": \"Priced below KBB Fair Purchase Price!

But you may be surprised at the extent of its lineup which ranges from an economical sedan to a V6-powered coupe or a hybrid rated up to 50 mpg. It&amp;#226;s hard to go wrong in any of them. Source: KBB.com * What began as a 2-door hatchback in 1976 has grown into today's full-size sedan. Like the rest of the car the Accord's 5-passenger interior is a pleasing step forward. The cabin boasts soft-touch materials for a quality feel. The front seats are comfortable and the driver's seat actually toned down the lumbar support. The rear seats have even more room as does the trunk. Sleek rippled sheet metal defines a more streamlined exterior that has shrunk around an interior that feels roomier than previous generations. The most surprising thing about the Accord is its refined continuously variable transmission (CVT). Mated to the 4-cylinder this CVT feels much like a normal automatic mimicking gear changes. Even a base Accord has good power for acceleration and passing yet attains an impressive mileage on the highway. Move up to a V6 model with 6-speed automatic transmission and the Accord is downright quick. For the individual looking to consume less the Accord comes as a Hybrid as well. This operates on a 141hp 2.0-liter 16-valve i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine and a 55hp lithium-ion battery pack for a net hp of 196. The Hybrid can achieve ratings of 50 cty and 46 hwy.

        "As a student with almost no programming background, I found the process of data cleaning to be both challenging and illuminating. But I also got to understand that data cleaning is a crucial and sometimes laborious step in the data analysis pipeline. There were some challenges along the way, but I relied on ChatGPT and on-class resources to help me get the job done.\n",

        "For the data cleaning process, my main work included removing duplicate rows and rows with missing values, as well as stripping text from columns such as 'doors,' 'mileage,' and 'price' to prepare the data for visualization. I also made modifications to the 'year' values, removed out-of-range and invalid data. However, if new data is added, these cleanup steps can essentially be reused without a lot of manual work. This is where I feel the benefit of using programming tools for data cleaning comes in.\n",

        "While navigating these data cleaning tasks, I found myself facing certain limitations due to my programming knowledge. Nevertheless, I persevered by posing questions that I believed would yield valuable insights. To enhance my understanding of the dataset, I conducted research outside of our data source. For instance, I investigated the generational changes in Honda Accord models and explored the variations in colors across these generations. This background knowledge allowed me to approach the data with fresh perspectives and generate relevant questions. Given more time, I would like to further refine the color column to provide more comprehensive answers to my questions. I believe if I could further categorize the colors and did a more comprehensive analysis of color variations could yield richer insights into consumer preferences and market trends."
